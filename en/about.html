<h1>PyCon APAC 2015</h1>
<p>PyCon APAC (Asia Pacific) is a conference organized by the Python community and for the community. It is an annual convention that can be enjoyed by Python users of all experience levels, from new users to core developers. The original PyCon was formed in North America in 2003, and now there are many other conferences being run in the PyCon spirit around the world.</p>

<p>To better serve all the attendees and the community, this year we publish the <a href="/2015apac/en/about/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. Please read it, and let's make a great conference together.</p>
